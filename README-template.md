### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

This project was mostly guided, however I did learn a lot about how to use figma premium to get a better idea for the styling of the projects, plus I really enjoyed working with js as this will be the first project with a programming language that I will be uploading to github.
